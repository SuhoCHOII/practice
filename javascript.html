        JavaScript</a></h2> 
        is <strong><u>a programming language that is 
        one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, 
        alongside HTML and CSS.
        </u></strong>
        As of 2022, 98% of websites use JavaScript on the client side
        for webpage behavior,often incorporating third-party libraries.
        All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to 
        execute the code on users' devices.

        <p>
            JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled 
            language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard. 
            It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation,
            and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting 
            event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. 
            It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working 
            with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, 
            and the Document Object Model (DOM).
